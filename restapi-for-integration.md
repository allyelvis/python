REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It's used for integration because it allows different software systems to communicate with each other, exchange data, and integrate their features.

Here's a basic example of how a REST API works:

1. **Client sends a request**: The client (which could be a web browser or another server) sends an HTTP request to the server. This request includes the method (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the URL, and any additional data.

```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

2. **Server processes the request**: The server receives the request, processes it, and returns an HTTP response. The response includes a status code, headers, and the requested data (if available).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

3. **Client handles the response**: The client receives the response and processes the data as needed.

In this example, the client requested data about the user with the ID 123. The server processed this request and returned the user's data in JSON format.

This is a simplified explanation, and actual API integrations can be much more complex, but the basic principles remain the same. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. This makes them very flexible and suitable for integration between different systems. They can be used to integrate web applications, mobile apps, databases, cloud services, and more. They are a key component in modern software architecture.
